### Project Description: Unsplash API Image Gallery with Dynamic Background Button
This project is a dynamic image gallery that utilizes the Unsplash API to search for and display images based on user input. The gallery includes an intuitive search bar where users can enter their desired keyword(s) to retrieve relevant images from Unsplash's vast collection.

Upon searching, the program fetches the images from the Unsplash API and presents them in a visually appealing grid layout. When a user clicks on an image, it expands to provide a better view, allowing users to examine the details of the image more closely.

To enhance the user experience, the project incorporates four different buttons that can be clicked to change the background color. These buttons serve as interactive elements and give users the ability to customize their viewing experience.

The application takes advantage of the useContext hook, a feature provided by React, to manage and access data across different components. This enables seamless communication between components, ensuring the efficient transfer of information and providing a smooth user experience.

Additionally, the project includes a button component that offers different styles and appearances for the buttons in the interface. This enhances the visual appeal and adds a touch of personalization to the application.

Overall, this image gallery application demonstrates the integration of the Unsplash API, providing users with a convenient way to search for and view images. The dynamic background buttons and use of React's useContext hook contribute to an engaging user experience, making the gallery both visually appealing and highly interactive.
